# Eviction Case Data Scraping Project

## Introduction 
This project is part of a research sponsored by Charles Center at College of William and Mary in Virginia, United States. Our plan is to create a open-source database of eviction data in Williamsburg and James City County. This involves web scraping from online docket (http://ewsocis1.courts.state.va.us/CJISWeb/circuit.jsp) and manually gather information from the court. A more detailed and accurate methodology would be updated later.

While we are still working on finding the right tools and writing the scripts, I would welcome any insights in the project. Feel free to contact me on matrix lolitsme:matrix.org or mastodon y_x at mastodon.social  for any questions/comments.You can also email me at: yxiao03@wm.edu. Still a newbie in web scraping, and any advice would be appreciated. If you want to make any contributions, please use pull request.
